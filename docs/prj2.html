      <p> ksdlfksdaj This C++ program simulates weather predictions over 50 days using a Markov chain model, where the weather conditions (Nice, Cloudy, and Raining) transition based on a predefined probability matrix. The program begins by initializing a 3x3 transition matrix that defines the likelihood of transitioning from one weather state to another. It starts with an initial weather condition on day 0, represented by a vector indicating a 100% chance of "Nice" weather. The program then performs matrix multiplication in a loop to compute the weather probabilities for each subsequent day, updating the weather state based on the transition probabilities. After each day's forecast is calculated, the probabilities for the next day are printed in percentage terms, and the program repeats this for 50 days, showing how the weather evolves over time based on the initial state and the transition matrix. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how a simple Markov chain can be used to model and predict future events (in this case, weather conditions) based on probabilities. </p>
