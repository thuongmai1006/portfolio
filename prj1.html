          <h2> Introduction </h2>
          <ol>
            <li>  Background  </li>
              <br>
              <p> This project is a computing program in C++ to estimate the alternative surface temperature distribution of a very long rectangular solid steel bar by breaking it to various locations within the surface and using the Finite Difference approach to roughly calculate the temperature allocation within the bar. Dev C++ 5.11 and “dislin” libraries are utilized.</p>
            <li> Project Overview  </li>
              <br>
              <p> Initially at 20 degrees Celsius, a long steel bar was placed in a temperature environment as shown in the figure. Determine the temperature distribution throughout the surface of the metal bar by chopping it into smaller areas and using a numerical differentiation method to estimate the temperature. </p>
